Git info : We encountered a lot of problems with this github : master wasn't accessible for the other members (with the exception of Axel) which means we couldn't push / pull anything, and if we could it was probably pure luck. In the end, only Axel could push properly and sometimes Léo or Jean-Baptiste, Claire couldn't push even once.
